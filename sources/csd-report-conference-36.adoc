== Introduction


CalConnect XXXVI took place on April 18-22, 2016, hosted by Ribose and OGCIO in Hong Kong, as part of a larger event, the Hong Kong 2016 ITFEST.  In addition to our regular conference and test event, we held a seminar at Hong Kong University, and a Public Day at the Hong Kong Convention Center on Wednesday.  The CalConnect Test Event (Monday and Tuesday) and Conference (Thursday and Friday) were held at the Cyberport, about 20 minutes from central Hong Kong.

The CalConnect Conference was attended by 22 people from 15 members,  plus 7 observers.  The Test Event was held on April 18-19, 2016, and had 13 participants from 9 members, plus 2 observers.

The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items more than ongoing work, in accordance with our new format, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon.  The Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect XXXVI Conference Schedule.

== Status of documents since last conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become internet draft submissions to the IEETF and ultimately be progressed to publication as RFCs (Proposed Standards), rather than directly published by CalConnect itself.

=== Published Documents
* Report on CalConnect Conference XXXV in Palo Alto, California
* Report on Interoperability Test Event XXXV


=== CalConnect Specifications Published as RFCs
* RFC 7808 Time Zone Data Distribution Service
* RFC 7809 CalDAV: Time Zones By Reference


=== CalConnect Drafts completed IETF WG Last Call
* New Properties for iCalendar
* Calendar Availability (VAVAILABILITY)

=== New and Updated CalConnect Drafts at the IETF
* v-event URI: A URI scheme for events
* WebDAV User Notifications
* WebDAV Resource Sharing
* CalCOnnect Calendar Sharing


== Technical Committee Work and Initiatives Going Forward

=== TC API

Working on a new key/value based data model.  Much of the work is done and the remainder will continue.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

Will be reactivated to consider authorization issues.

=== TC CALDAV

Created initial draft of STRUCTURED-DATA iCalendar property - allows schema-based data to be included with an event/task

Created rough draft for scoped attendee parameters - allows control of which parameter(s) are sent in scheduling messages - initial draft in progress

Working on iCalendar-based patch/diff format - initial draft in progress

=== TC DEVGUIDE

Basic content for a single event is complete along with some other material.  DEVGUIDE has been styled to fit with he CalConnect web site in appearance.

=== TC EVENTPUB

Reviewed DMOZ directory service as source of categorization but it doesn’t provide all the needed info.  Will continue with editing approach of providing a web service to search and retrieve categories, but not invent something ourselves.

=== TC FREEBUSY

Dormant

=== TC FSC

To be merged into TC SHARING.

=== TC IMIP

Investigating how/why particular MIME formats are used by vendors, in particular application/ics content-type.

=== TC IOPTEST

Conducted Interoperability Testing at CalConnect XXXVI.  Looking at rebranding the test event as Developer’s Forum.

=== TC ISCHEDULE

Dormant.  Specification is essentially complete but pending on other specs at the IETF which have a higher priority.

=== TC PUSH

Draft to be published to the IETF after CalConnect XXXVI.

=== TC RESOURCE

Dormant

=== TC SHARING

Specifications completed over the last few weeks. Need to get some implementations and do some testing. New CalDAV tester tests would help. TC-Sharing will take on the work of coming up with a subscription model. How to upgrade subscriptions to something more efficient than periodic polling of an ics file.

=== TC TASKS

Dormant

=== TC TIMEZONE

RFCs 7808 and 7809 published.  Closed by decision of CalConnect Plenary XXXVI.

Provisional Committees PC QR (QRCODE include vCard info) and PC SEC (Security and Encryption)  established, to report out at CalConnect XXXVII

TC AUTODISCOVERY will be reactivated
