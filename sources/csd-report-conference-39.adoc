== Introduction

CalConnect XXXIX took place on June 12-16, 2017, hosted by Tandem in Seattle, Washington.  The CalConnect Test Event (Monday,  Tuesday, and Wednesday morning) and Conference (Wednesday afternoon, Thursday and Friday) were held at Tandem’s headquarters at Galvanize in Seattle.

The CalConnect Conference was attended by 16 people from 9 members plus a representative from the IETF.  The Test Event/Developers Forum had 8 participants from 5 members and was largely devoted to the forum rather than specific testing.

The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon.  The Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect XXXIX Conference Schedule.
